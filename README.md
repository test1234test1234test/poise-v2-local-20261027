# Disposable Poise v2 sandbox

Toy work only. No production deployment, upstream fork, production credentials, or production work references. All orchestration runs locally.

## Numeric clamp

Import the named `clamp(value, min, max)` export from `lib/clamp.mjs`:

```js
import { clamp } from './lib/clamp.mjs';

clamp(5, 0, 10); // 5
clamp(-1, 0, 10); // 0
clamp(11, 0, 10); // 10
clamp(3, 2, 2); // 2 (equal bounds are valid)
```

All three arguments must be finite primitive numbers. Invalid or missing
arguments throw `TypeError`, without coercion or mutation. This validation runs
first; if all arguments are valid but `min > max`, the function throws
`RangeError`.

Bounds are inclusive. An in-range value is returned unchanged, preserving its
sign when it is zero, even with equal bounds: `Object.is(clamp(-0, 0, 0), -0)` is
`true`. Out-of-range values return the corresponding bound unchanged. Fractions,
subnormal numbers, and the full finite number range are supported.

Run the regression tests with `node --test` (also available as `npm test`).
